# Data_Analysis_Scripts

This repository contains scripts I developed during my research and use for data analysis. I research numerical analysis and scientific computing; hence, these scripts have helped me present my results concisely and run them efficiently on a system. You can use these files, but I would be glad if you could cite the repository.

## Implemented Programs

### plot_results.py

This script generates plots from the given data sets.

- **Features:** Reads data from files, processes the data, and creates visual plots to help analyze results effectively.

### run_multiple_tests.py

This script runs multiple tests on a system to analyze performance and accuracy.

- **Features:** Executes a series of tests, collects results, and provides a summary of the performance metrics.

## Usage

To use these scripts, clone the repository and run the desired Python file. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, which typically include NumPy, Matplotlib, and other scientific computing libraries.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Data_Analysis_Scripts.git
cd Data_Analysis_Scripts
python3 plot_results.py
# or
python3 run_multiple_tests.py
```

## Citation

If you use these scripts in your research or project, please cite this repository. This helps others find and utilize this work.
