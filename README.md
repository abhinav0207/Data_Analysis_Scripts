This repository contains scripts I developed during my research and use for data analysis. I research numerical analysis and scientific computing; hence, these scripts have helped me present my results concisely and run them efficiently on a system. You can use these files, but I would be glad if you could cite the repository.

Some examples of my research can be seen here:
